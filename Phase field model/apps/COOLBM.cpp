/// The double-population scheme allocates a second array of size Ntot × 19, hereafter called out. While this strategy doubles the total 
/// memory requirements, it simplifies the algorithm, as both the fk(t) and fout(t) values are stored at the memory location popk, while the k
/// streamed variables fk(t + 1) are kept separately in outk. Therefore, the collision and streaming steps can be fused 
/// (i.e. they are executed within a single memory traversal), as any access conflicts are naturally avoided. After a time 
/// iteration, an exchange of the arrays pop and out guarantees that the streamed, temporary populations are reused for the subsequent cycle.
